## Overview

### Project Description

This was my fourth solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. Solo project means that you are only provided with a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor and you're on your own.

A stretch goal in this project was to add 1-click-copy which was quite interesting to implement.

More features I added myself:
- when the user clicks on the color then the RGB value will be copied to the clipboard
- when the user clicks on the color code then the HEX code will be copied to the clipboard
- a hovering 'Copied!' text when the password has been copied on the clipboard

New things learned:
- retrieve data from an API utilizing fetch()
- utilize async and await instead of .then()
- manipulate the data retrieved from the API

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.

The code has been reviewed and approved by a Scrimba instructor.
