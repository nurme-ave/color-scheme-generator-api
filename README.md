## Overview

### Project Description

In this JavaScript project I'm utilizing async & await for fetching data from the Color API.

I broke up my code into 5 separate files to make it modular. This helps to keep things more organized, reuse the code, and it's easier to make changes to the code if necessary.

Based on the user's color choice I'm doing 2 things here: a) changing the colors of the text on the left panel, b) changing the background color of the website either to black or white.

When the user clicks on the color or color code then the RGB value or HEX code will be copied onto the clipboard (1-click-copy), respectively. A hovering 'Copied!' text will also appear on the screen after copying.

I also added a cool fade-in animation effect to both the text panel and the color generator panel.

The page has been built with mobile-first design in mind and is fully responsive.
