## Overview

### Project Description

This was my fourth solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. Solo project means that you are only provided with the Figma design file and a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor. How you solve the challenge and implement the logic is completely up to you.

A stretch goal in this project was to add 1-click-copy which was quite interesting to implement.

More features I added myself:
- when the user clicks on the color then the RGB value will be copied to the clipboard
- when the user clicks on the color code then the HEX code will be copied to the clipboard
- a hovering 'Copied!' text when the password has been copied on the clipboard

New things learned:
- retrieve data from an API utilizing fetch()
- manipulate the data retrieved from the API

The page was built first for desktop and then I optimized it for mobile view.

The code has been reviewed and approved by a Scrimba instructor.
